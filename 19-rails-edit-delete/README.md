## Objectives 

- Send and receive PATCH, PUT, DELETE requests
- Use before_actions to DRY our coderails

## Questions So Far
- Why does form_for take a block?
- form_for vs form_tag vs form_with
- nested params hash construction
- why can't we just pass in the taco params as a whole hash?
- Is CSS built-in to Rails?
- 

form_for: Used when creating or editing an ActiveRecord model

form_tag:  Everything

Put vs Patch
    - Put replaces a resource in your database
    - Patch updates a resource in your database
